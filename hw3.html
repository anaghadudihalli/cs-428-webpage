                        <p>Google Translate has always had a lot of potential considering there are so many languages in the world. But integrating it with AR and this live translation has upped the game by a big margin. This technology has a whole lot of potential and I can see it being used on a regular basis when done cautiously.
                        </p>
                        <p>When I went to Japan in 2018, this app alone powered my travel. From using it to translate bills, to translate signs, to translate English to Japanese for locals to understand and for them to speak to it as it translated it for me. Though taking out the phone wasn’t very inconvenient, a hands-free experience with AR glasses will make the experience much better.

                        </p>
                        <p>As seen in the pictures, there are still a lot of errors, glitches, wrong translations, flying text for it to be convenient. While it’s still extremely useful as a tourist who needs something small and quick to get by, it cannot be used for something more serious like reading books in a different language. But that’s on the translation side. Even in AR, it needs a lot of improvement. For eg., why is it converting text that’s already in English? Or when I am translating Spanish to English, why does it try to translate a different language that’s present as well? The text keeps changing, isn’t stable and even flies out of place many times. We can’t use it while on the go since we need to stay still and let it settle. How amazing would it be if we could just wear our AR glasses and read entire books in a different language by live translating? It can be taken a step further if we can even have live voice translation along with it as it can help visually impaired as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>Though it sounds interesting, I do think users should definitely have control over when the translation toggle is on. As a user, we do want the control to know what is in its original language rather than everything being automatically translated for us. Also, what if the computer doesn’t understand the nuances of words and translates mechanically? There are certain words which have different meanings across different languages. For example, though gift in English means a present, in German it means poison, while in Scandinavian languages it can mean both poison and marriage! Are machines smart enough to distinguish that yet? Since it replaces the original text with the augmented text, this places a lot of responsibility on the third party. It would be highly dangerous if some third party starts translating original text to something entirely else misleading the population. Who is to be held responsible if something goes wrong?                        </p>
                        <p>What if this discourages people from learning a new language? But it can also encourage learning. How cool would it be if instead of translating in its own place, we can get the translation below it? Like subtitles in a movie? People can wear these AR glasses, and each can get the movie translated to different languages. Users need to have the control over where they want the translation to be done, on top of or below the original text. This can help reduce the language barrier and get the world even closer to each other.</p>
                        <p>So while this is a very ambitious project - having live translation always ‘on’ our AR glasses, there are a lot of political, social, and economic factors to consider. Technology, especially such a technology which literally has the capability to overlay what we see with something synthetic, a lot of research needs to be done before it’s ready to be used in public.
