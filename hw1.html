                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: turquoise ">Smartphone based AR</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Easily accessible. Pretty much everyone these days has a smartphone.</li>
                                <li>Portable</li>
                                <li>Low extra cost compared to dedicated VR headsets. One doesn’t need to pay anything more for AR experience. It’s what one pays for rest of the smartphone.
                                </li>
                                <li>Safer than other platforms since no headset/covering of vision is involved.
                                </li>
                                <li>As easy as just downloading an app. 
                                </li>
                                <li>No extra controls/gestures to learn. Anyone(even children, older adults) can use it.
                                </li>
                                <li>Very low bar to AR games.
                                </li>
                                <li>Doesn’t need to have high processing power.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Easily accessible. Pretty much everyone these days has a smartphone.
                                </li>

                                </li>
                                <li>As easy as just downloading an app. 
                                </li>
                                <li>No extra controls/gestures to learn. Just move around the phone. Anyone(even children, older adults) can use it.
                                </li>
                                <li>Covers the limitations of smartphone based AR as this is way more immersive. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Uses gyroscope to detect phone movements, and hence easier to insert it in Google Cardboard and turn it into a proper VR headset. This makes a smartphone easily turn into a VR headset.
                                </li>
                                <li>Having a 360 view video means you can visit Antarctica, have virtual tours of houses, different tourist attractions all over the world (especially useful during this pandemic) etc right from your couch.
                                </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Gives a 360-degree VR experience which gives a much more immersive experience.
                                </li>
                                <li>Much more powerful than a smartphone. Can create powerful games without being limited by the hardware constraints of a mobile phone.
                                </li>
                                <li>Sound system can be added to the experience.
                                </li>
                                <li>Controllers are easy to use.
                                </li>
                                <li>Wireless which gives an even better ‘real’ non-obstructive (by wires) experience.
                                </li>
                                <li>Bigger rooms can be used to get a bigger area for games.
                                </li>
                                <li>Games can be much more ‘real’.
                                </li>
                                <li>Having a 360 view (for real this time, unlike 360 video) means you can visit Antarctica, have virtual tours of houses, different tourist attractions all over the world (especially useful during this pandemic) etc right from your couch.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: turquoise ">Room scale displays (CAVE2)</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lets multiple people experience the same ‘reality’ at the same time so the experience isn’t isolated anymore.
                                </li>
                                <li>Useful for large-scale scientific and professional collaboration.
                                </li>
                                <li>Provides scientists with better ways to manage the complexity of the data. Can study multiple data at the same time. (Data on the displays, and specialized data on individual’s laptops)
                                </li>
                                <li>The objects can be seen using regular 3D glasses. But it also supports handheld controllers (“wands”) and motion-sensor tracking.
                                </li>
                                <li>Safer than head mounted displays since you can still see your surroundings and won’t trip and fall.
                                </li>
                                <li>Very immersive experience since there are displays on all the walls around you.
                                </li>
                                <li>Bigger displays means you can see images - life size.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
