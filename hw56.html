                    <br>
                        <p>For my first review I chose Anthony Venturella’s project. He worked on completing all the undergraduate requirements. He has put in a lot of timely effort and it can be seen by how sophisticated the widgets are, how the functionalities are so detailed and well done. He even included an android apk so that people don’t have to build it themselves. That’s very thoughtful of him.
                        </p>
                        <p>I first tried to run the application in my android phone using the apk but the application had issues scanning the tracker. I then shifted to running it on my system in Unity and it worked without any issues. The directions provided were helpful and on point.
                        </p>
                        <p>Starting with the clock widget, I loved how retro it looked. It truly looked like we had one of our clocks from the olden days.I liked the small detailing on the clocks like buttons to change the setting, the antenna, the power off button, the stands to support the clock. The font of the displayed text also fits in the space. The 3D text is placed properly, doesn’t come out, or go into the surface. I also liked how he colored the display black and the rest of the body red. Overall, the modeling of this clock was top notch, detailed and very realistic. I can totally see myself using it on my table - AR or a physical one that looks like this one.
                        </p>
                        <p>Next up, the calendar widget. Again, the calendar widget was so realistic! When kept on the table, I took a couple of seconds to realize that it’s not real. The text is properly placed, with proper distances between the month, day, and the year. The thickness of the calendar signifies that it has those many pages/days left, how tear off desk calendars do. It also leans against a stand. I really like how both clock and calendar widgets follow a theme. It can nicely fit in a similar color themed house.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coming to the wind direction and speed widget, I like how he has a small stand mentioning the directions. So the user doesn’t have to keep wondering how they have to place the widget to read the data correctly. It’s very convenient. I appreciate that he has included very detailed directions like South-South-East than just the four directions. The flag not only points at the appropriate direction but also opens up/becomes bigger based on how fast the wind is blowing. That’s very smart. Because it does look like an umbrella that opens up more if the wind is faster.</p>
                        <p>The humidity and temperature widgets are dynamic which dynamically change the length of the liquid as the data changes. He also displays the data on the stand which is very easy to read even at a distance. The outside body of the beakers look quite translucent and hence, like real beakers. I personally struggled to (and couldn’t) do this myself so I can see how much effort that is.</p>
                        <p>And finally coming to my most favorite part of his project, and interestingly so. I really love the entire setup of the 3D icon showing the main condition. He went beyond what was asked and also modeled a cute little environment with terrains as well. That makes it stand apart and when you look at it, it looks like you’re looking at a mini-world of that weather condition. He made the terrain a little rocky to make it look real, it has rocks, a tree.  The terrain changes to all snow (with a snowman) when it’s snowing. The sun has light sunshine rays around it. The clouds are relatively sized. The rain actually looks like water. But my favorite has to be the thunder. He used particle system for this, and it just changed the game entirely. I am totally gonna learn that and use it in my future projects as well. All the sounds are appropriate, not annoying and fade as you go farther.
                        </p>
                        <p>He clearly put a lot of effort into making these widgets as realistic as possible rather than just wanting to get them done. A lot of thought and effort has gone into making this project which makes it my most favorite project of the lot.
                        </p>

                        </h3>
                        <br>
                        <img src="./pictures/week56/review2.png" width="100%">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <p>For my second review, I chose Harish Venkataraman’s project. It’s one of my favorites because this is the only project which has covered all the requirements ( graduate and undergraduate). Harish did a wonderful job of implementing all the features, and smartly so.
                            </p>
                            <p>I like how professional Harish’s presentation was. It was edited and polished, ran through all the information and packages required, showed where exactly to place the API key etc. Because of which it was extremely easy to follow and set up the project within minutes.
                            </p>
                            <p>I like how minimalistic the clock and calendars are. They perfectly fit in a minimalistic home without any jazz. Calendar has a very rubbery-plastic texture which makes it look very real. Both have little stands attached to them which make them perfect desk widgets. Harish also implemented the graduate requirement - changing units on pressing ‘U’ key. The process was seamless and the data changed appropriately.
                            </p>
                            <p>I love the thermometer and the humidity widgets. He found a very innovative work around where he placed two cylinders on top of each other and the size of the cylinders acting as the liquids dynamically scale in size to show the amount of liquid in the thermometer and beaker according to their corresponding readings. It’s quite smart. I couldn’t do this myself so I can appreciate this a lot more. I also like how the water in the beaker moves, like how real water does. WOW. How did he do that? That’s brilliant. Again, the temperature displayed by the thermometer can be switched to metric units by pressing the ‘U’ key.
                            </p>
                            <p>The flag post represents the wind direction and speed and the direction of the flag represents the direction of wind. Pretty neat, huh? Harish guided the direction to place the marker so as to be able to read the data correctly and that helped quite a lot.
                            </p>
                            <p>Finally, coming to the best part and my most favorite part of the project. He used the mars front marker to show all the nine main weather conditions. I really like how re-usable the models are. He used spheres to make the clouds. It sounds so simple but I couldn’t think of it. I went out of my way to make clouds using probuilder, making the process unnecessarily a lot more complex. But as it can be seen that much more realistic and simple clouds can be made using basic unity primitives. He used the same cloud structure and just changed the color of the top spheres to make black/grey clouds. Brilliant! I like the color of the sun, looks very sunny. It doesn’t look metallic. I tried my best, but my materials still look metallic, so I really appreciate and wonder how he did it. He let the user go through all the weather conditions by pressing the ‘space’ button. I really love how he used particle systems to make rain, snow and mist. It makes it look so much more real and immersive than maybe translating a model down. Looking at the code, the implementation of the project is extremely efficient. He dynamically instantiated and destroyed objects which makes the program faster and space efficient over time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Overall, I really enjoyed playing with Harish’s project. He had some really smart, innovative ways to solve problems and I will be looking forward to seeing more of his projects.
                            </p>

                        </h3>
                        <br>
                        <img src="./pictures/week56/review3.png" width="100%">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <p>I chose Manuel Martinez’s project for my third review because I found his models and him very creative and out of the box.
                            </p>
                            <p>Starting with the calendar widget, I like how he has his jewel theme going on. The base has a diamond texture while the actual display for the calendar looks like it’s made of marble. While others tried to make it look traditional, realistic, I appreciate that he took the creative way.
                            </p>
                            <p>Next up is the clock widget. Even that has the same jewel theme going on. I like the uniformity and the theme already. It has two marble supports on the side and a rocky base with unique cuts. The display itself is slightly translucent which gives a jewel ruby look. I love it. I LOVE the different rocky textures. The texture fits perfectly, aligns perfectly with the model. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Coming to the fissure marker holding the thermometer and the humidity widget. These widgets too have a marble theme going on. I like how the beaker is of cylindrical shape, which gives it a different ancient feel and goes along with the marble theme perfectly. The outside body of the beakers look quite transparent and hence, like real beakers. It legit looks like glass. Manuel’s texture game is on point! I personally struggled to (and couldn’t) do this myself so I can see how much effort that is. The size of the liquid/ cylinders dynamically scale to represent the amount of liquid in the thermometer and the beaker according to their corresponding readings.
                            </p>
                            <p>Next is my favorite widget of the project, the wind speed and direction! I personally struggled the most with modeling this widget because I couldn't think of creative ways to do so. But Manuel came up with such a great idea. It has an earthly texture which looks like it’s on the ground ( like how it is for real). That’s such a simple idea but still most don’t think of it. The directions to place the widget is mentioned on the widget itself, which is super helpful. All the different parts of the widgets have their own texture and color. The direction of the arrow changes dynamically based on the corresponding wind direction. Manuel took a unique approach to wind speed which I didn’t think of. He has a spinning arrow next to the pole. Its spinning speed depends on the wind speed. It’s a simple but such a powerful tool to represent wind speed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>And finally coming to the 3D icon widget. Manuel too has a terrain like Anthony which is a nice subtle addition. The icons have a loud, audible, appropriate sound to go along with the condition. He has a virtual button to cycle through all the conditions. Sun has triangular rays that translate. I like the cloud models, very realistic, that animate by going around the sun. That’s a very clever animation involving translation. I also like how he made the water drops. Very simple but easy to understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>I really enjoyed Manuel’s different but creative take on the widgets. There’s a lot to learn from his project and his way of doing things.
                            </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3 style="color: turquoise; text-align: center;">Review 4 : Jeff Guo

                        </h3>
                        <br>
                        <img src="./pictures/week56/review4.png" width="100%">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <p>My last and final review is on Jeff Guo’s project. His project immediately caught my attention as I saw knowledge coming out of a book haha! I had to check it out and I wasn’t disappointed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Jeff has a unique medieval/mystic theme going on and I am so here for it. I think it will go great with a similar themed house.
                            </p>
                            <p>Let’s start with the temperature and humidity widget. The temperature widget has a unique, very distinctive shape. It has smoke coming out of the widget which makes sense as it may mean the temperature is turning the liquid into smoke. It has a very cute book which displays the current temperature and the humidity. The number of drops signifies humidity which also changes from 1 to 4 depending on the percentage. It is quite simple and easy to understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>Next is the wind direction widget. I really like all the flags and how there are four small flags indicating the directions. That is a very smart user design, and creative way to let the users know which direction is which. Users don’t have to worry about placing the widget in a particular way. The direction of the flag dynamically changes based on the current wind direction. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Next are the time and date widgets or as Jeff says ‘Scroll of the clock’ and ‘Book of the forbidden date’. The book has smoke coming out of it and on top of it lies the cuboid which shows the date. I like that the date is shown on all sides of the cuboid since when it’s placed on a surface, and the user may see it from any angle. It makes sense and will be quite useful if the information can be seen from all the angles.                            </p>
                            <p>Lastly let’s come to the 3D icon showing the main weather condition. Jeff shows all the nine conditions. The sun icon looks like a real fireball which you may get scared to touch. The texture is very realistic and also has sun rays around it, which I believe is using particle system. He used spheres and extruded some sides to make the clouds. It sounds so simple but I couldn’t think of it. I went out of my way to make clouds using probuilder, making the process unnecessarily a lot more complex. But as it can be seen that much more realistic and simple clouds can be made using basic unity primitives. Snowflakes are very nicely modeled and look comforting. The mist icon is made using particle system again, which looks great! But my favorite has to be the raining icons. There are just so many drops, very neatly distanced and placed. I can only imagine the effort gone into making AND animating them. It looks like it’s raining inside my house itself! All the icons have a unique looping, audible but not annoying sound that further helps in displaying the main weather condition. I also appreciate the small display on top of the icons, which can be used to display the much detailed main condition like smoke ( under mist).
                            </p>
                            <p>I think Jeff’s project was really distinctive. I like his unique way of thinking and storytelling which definitely makes a project much more interesting and appealing.
