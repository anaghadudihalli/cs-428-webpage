                    <p>Screenshots of viewing the Moon and Saturn through SkyView. I initially wondered why the moon was a black circle. But later I realized it’s because it’s New Moon!</p>

                    <br>
                        <p>I tried both the apps suggested - SkyTracker and SkyView. I didn’t like SkyTracker as it didn’t augment the celestial objects on top of my surroundings. Skyview did a much better job at that. It made it look very realistic, and I felt included in the scene. Just by pointing at the space around you, it tells where different stars, planets, constellations, and other celestial objects are located. It also lets me search what I am looking for, and would direct me towards it which was extremely helpful. Such applications use our location, gyroscope, and built-in compass to implement this.</p>
                        <p>This technology has a lot of potential. You don’t have to be an astronomer with a lot of expert knowledge to recognize them. You don’t need to have a telescope at home. You don’t need a star map. These days you don’t even get to see a clear sky because of all the pollution. Even if you have a clear sky, sometimes you can’t see the different celestial objects if you have trees, mountains, etc covering up. But with this, you don’t need to go to a remote unpolluted place to see the sky clearly. You don’t need to wake up at 4 AM to see that meteor shower. All you have to do is point your phone at it. Anyone with a smartphone can enjoy this technology. It’s also a very educational tool for children who can learn these more practically.</p>
                        <p>It is a good enough experience with a smartphone but it is slightly inconvenient since the phone screen isn’t big enough. Having this technology embedded in AR glasses would mean a wide-angle view, as big as my eyes can see. The experience is also much better and more immersive with the glasses. You can just lie down on your back on your terrace, wear these glasses, actually relax and stargaze. But these applications currently provide a lot of information that can clutter the view. Users should be allowed to change the level of details or when they want the details to be shown. One addition can be to show these celestial objects only when I am outside and looking at the sky (as opposed to now where it shows even when I am indoors and looking at the ground/building as they were below the horizon.) without any textual details on them. With AR glasses, it will be as if I mapped a natural starry sky on top of mine.</p>
                        <p>This technology can be extended to include more details about the objects when pointed at them. It can probably have more pictures, fun facts, distance from the Earth, links to other reading sources like Wikipedia, etc. SkyView has a few of these already but it will be much more educative if it can include more details. I personally wish to visit Northern Lights but haven’t got the chance yet. It would have been really beautiful if I could augment those like other celestial objects in ‘my night’ as well. Other objects in the sky can be included as well such as satellites or airplanes or even birds flying in the sky. You can maybe have details about the airplane like where it’s going, the aircraft model number, its destination city, etc. Though scanning the airplane can mean violation of the privacy of people in it and/or also get into the hands of the wrong people. It doesn’t have to be limited to the sky and can include other natural objects too, such as plants, insects, animals, birds, or even below the earth like tectonic plates. You can point at a bird during bird watching and see all the information about the bird. You can scan plants, insects, animals to know which are dangerous, poisonous, and which are not.</p>
                        <p>Overall I think it’s a very promising technology and with AR glasses, it can bring us slightly closer to nature.</p>
