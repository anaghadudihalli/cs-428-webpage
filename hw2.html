                        <p>Augmented Reality can completely change the world how we see it. The opportunities are ample and can be used in almost all the fields, be it education, tourism, shopping, entertainment etc. We can just point our mobile phone at anything we wish and see all the information we require. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Personally I get very annoyed when many items in the store don’t have a price label attached to it. Maybe in the future with AR, we can just point at the item, and we get all the information we need - price, expiry date, ingredients. How simple will shopping get?! I also don’t remember where things are kept in supermarkets. Usually I just look up for an item on the supermarket’s online website, and get the aisle number.  But still it’s a struggle to find that aisle. But with AR, we can maybe get the directions in front of us, so that we don’t have to get lost. Just like how Google Maps does it.

                        </p>
                        <p>How cute and useful would it be if we have the store’s mascot showing us the directions? Or a 3D human helper? If we are wearing glasses, maybe we can always keep a tab on the total amount and buy responsibly!
                        </p>
                        <p>Google Maps Navigation can be extended to having AR navigation on the road itself so that you don’t have to look away from the road. But it can also have implications in the sense, it may cover some important road signs or maybe vehicles themselves.</p>
                        <p>Google Maps can also implement AR in different attractions. Tourists don’t have to search for information boards. They can have all the information they need like history, importance of the monument just by pointing their phone at it. AR can also be used for live translation of foreign languages, like Google translate.</p>
                        <p>We already have many mobile applications like Houzz, DecorMatters, Homestyler etc in the market where you can just place the 3D model furniture on the floor, in your house space and see how it looks for real before buying it, how big it is etc. You can also style your entire apartment like the paint color, carpet, false ceilings etc. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Hololens also make a very interesting use case of AR. With those glasses, you can have your remote coworkers in your workspace. Your remote co-workers are no longer remote. All employees can be next to each other increasing collaboration and efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>Students can see models of what they are studying in AR which can help them understand in a much better way. Like using Google AR for skeleton or Apple’s AR that lets you dissect a frog. Education doesn’t need to remain 2D anymore!
                        </p>
                        <p>AR is already being used in gaming and that’s changing the way people play. People no longer just have to look at their screens. It’s way more interactive and immersive with your real world involved. For eg, Pokemon Go. Isn’t it so much fun to go around and catch pokemons like  real pokemon trainers! 
                        </p>
                        <p>In concerts, often the celebrities either aren’t seen or look so small. We can improve that experience by having an AR image of them live through AR glasses. Kind of how it was shown in the HBO TV series Silicon Valley! 
                        </p>
                        <p>AR glasses bring all these advantages along with the fact that they are hands free! They will be much more realistic in the sense, you are not viewing them from a phone but looking at it through your eyes. Wearing glasses will also reduce the distractions and the accidents caused by the distractions drastically since you are not looking away to look at your phone.
